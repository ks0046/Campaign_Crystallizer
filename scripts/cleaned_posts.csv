Hi yall. My girlfriend and I are in an urgent situation and need a safe place to stay for a night or two. We’re both LGBTQ+ and recently escaped a really toxic and unsafe family environment. We have a sweet dog (with ptsd due to witnessing abuse) and a cat with us — both are vaccinated and good.

We’ve been staying in hotels when we can scrape together the money, but we’ve hit a wall and are out of funds. We’re just looking for a safe spot to sleep, even floor space is enough. We’re clean, respectful, and can help with housework, pet care, or anything else you might need in exchange.

If you know of anyone with a spare room, couch, or floor space, or any resources/shelters that truly allow pets, please message me.

1ltvvqv,"Multiple arrests made, officers targeted when 'large and unruly crowd' formed in East Carson Street corridor, police say","Turmoil continued in Pittsburgh’s South Side entertainment district over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, in which shots were fired, people threw fireworks and other objects at officers, and several people were arrested or charged.

City police [have been making a concerted effort](https://triblive.com/local/south-sides-late-night-reverly-prompts-fresh-scrutiny-and-familiar-fears/) recently to address rowdiness in the area.

Police said a “large and unruly crowd” gathered in the East Carson Street corridor Friday evening into early Saturday morning.

Officers in the 1400 block of Sarah Street heard shots fired around 1 a.m. Saturday. No injuries or property damage were reported.

Ronald Pelton, 23, of McKees Rocks was apprehended on the street and a firearm was recovered, police said. Another man fled the area on foot, police said.

Pelton is charged with discharging a firearm, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct, public drunkenness and possession of a weapon. He was released Sunday from the Allegheny County Jail after posting $100, 10% of a $1,000 bail, according to court records.

Around 2 a.m., police began to disperse the remaining crowd after giving multiple warnings. People in the crowed began throwing projectiles and launching lit fireworks at officers and police vehicles.

Two officers suffered eye irritation from firework debris while another was hit by a rock, police said. All three declined medical attention from medics on-scene.

Officers used pepper spray and inert vapor or smoke only after they and their vehicles were targeted with projectiles, police said.

1lq66bj,Southbound Route 28 Ramp to Northbound Route 8 Long-term Closure Begins Monday in Allegheny County,"**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**July 2, 2025**

 

**MEDIA CONTACT**: Steve Cowan, 412-429-5010

 

**Southbound Route 28 Ramp to Northbound Route 8 Long-term Closure Begins Monday in Allegheny County**

 

**Pittsburgh, PA** – PennDOT District 11 is announcing reconstruction work on the ramp from southbound Route 28 to northbound Route 8 in Shaler Township and Sharpsburg Borough, Allegheny County will begin Monday, July 7 weather permitting.

 

Beginning at approximately 6 a.m. Monday, the ramp that carries traffic from southbound Route 28 to northbound Route 8 (North 8/Butler Exit 5) will close to traffic around-the-clock through Thursday, July 31. Crews will conduct ramp reconstruction work. Ramp traffic will be detoured.

 

Posted Detour

* Continue on southbound Route 28 past the closed ramp
* Take the Millvale (Exit 3) off-ramp
* Continue straight onto East Ohio Street
* Turn left onto the ramp from North 28 toward Etna
* From northbound Route 28, take the left-hand off-ramp to North 8 toward Butler (Exit 5B)
* End detour

 

This $9.14 million project located in the City of Pittsburgh, Etna Borough, and Shaler Township began in August 2024 with inlet improvements on Route 8 (Butler Street). The project is located between Baker Street and the 62^(nd) Street Bridge in the southern portion of the limits and includes milling and resurfacing, retaining wall repairs, and the installation of a barrier to separate travel lanes from a future shared-use path. The northern limits of the project are between the 62^(nd) Street Bridge and Saxonburg Boulevard and includes concrete pavement restoration and preservation work on two structures carrying Route 8 over Pine Creek. Additional work throughout the project includes sign and signal upgrades, guide rail updates, drainage work, ADA curb ramp updates, pavement markings/delineation installation, and other miscellaneous construction. The majority of work will be completed under short-term single-lane closures during off-peak daylight, overnight, and weekend hours. However, there will be three separate one-way detours of the 62^(nd) Street Bridge in 2025, a weekend detour of Saxonburg Boulevard at the intersection with Route 8, and a detour for the reconstruction of the ramp carrying Route 28 southbound traffic onto northbound Route 8. The project is anticipated to conclude late in 2025.
